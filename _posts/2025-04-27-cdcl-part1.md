## A Simple Implementation of CDCL


### SAT

The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is the problem 
of determining whether a Boolean expression can be true.
A simple example of an expression that can't be true is 
`a /\ !a`. Whether `a` is true or not, in both cases the whole expression 
is false.

SAT is NP-complete, so we are looking for algorithms that are good in practice 
rather than any guarantees on a bound.

Although in general we are looking to solve SAT on an arbitrary 
clause, we can work with expressions in conjunctive normal form 
(CNF). CNF means that we have a conjunction of disjunctions of
possibly negated variables.

```
CNF examples
a /\ (!a \/ b) (!b \/ c)
Not CNF
a /\ !(a \/ b)
a /\ (!a \/ (b /\ c))
```

The possibly negated variable is called an atom and the disjunction
is called a clause.

It is possible to find an equisatisfiable CNF for an arbitrary
Boolean proposition, but I won't go into details. We can even
go to clauses with at most 3 literals (this problem is called 3-SAT).

### Unit propagation

Many algorithms for SAT rely on unit propagation. Unit propagation allows us to find
variables that must be true or false from other variables.

Suppose we have that all but one of our atoms are false. Then the last atom must be true and
we can add it to the current assignment. This is called unit propagation.

While doing this we can also check if all are false. This is called a conflict and it 
means our partial assignment cannot be extended to a full assignment.

### DPLL

The Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm is a simple algorithm for solving SAT.
It has the following pseudocode

```
dpll(clauses, partial_assignment):
  let atom = pick unassigned variable and polarity.
  let extended_assignment = unit_prop(partial_assignment + atom)
  if (extended_assignment != null) {
    let result = dpll(clauses, extended_assignment)
    if result != null return result
  }
  
  let opposite_assignment = unit_prop(partial_assignment + !atom)
  if (opposite_assignment == null) return null;
  return dpll(clauses, partial_assignment)
```

In simple terms, we guess an atom, and we do unit propagation before making more guesses.
If either step fails, we guess the opposite. If they both fail, we fail and return to the caller
to let it make another guess.

This is relatively inefficient if we guess badly. We could spend a lot of time 
down an incorrect path with the intermediate guesses not being helpful.

### CDCL

Conflict-driven clause learning attempts to learn from the places where we backtrack.
Instead of just backtracking, we add a new clause based on the conflict. We also
backtrack to where we can learn from the conflict.

In this pseudocode, we will assume mutable assignments

```
cdcl(clauses):
  let assignments = [];
  let assignment_stack = []
  while there are unassigned variables:
    conflict = unit_prop(clauses, assignments)
    if (conflict != null):
      if len(assignment_stack) == 0:
        return UNSAT
      new_clause = analyse_conflict(conflict, assignments)
      clauses.add(new_clause)
      new_depth = second highest assignment depth in new_clause
      while len(assignment_stack) > new_depth
        assignments = assignment_stack.pop    
    else:
      assignment_stack.push(assignments.copy())
      guess = pick an unassigned variable and polarity 
      assignments.add(guess)

```

It's worth noting that in practice we may backtrack further than the second highest assignment
in the clause.


#### Derivation Graphs and Learning

If we want to learn from a conflict, we need to know why it happens. To do this, we keep track of a derivation
graph which shows why each atom was inferred or guessed. We also keep track of the level at which we inferred the variable.

This gives us a DAG of assignments with each assigned atom as a node. 
We can then take a cut through the DAG. As long as the guesses are all on the left side of the cut, 
we can construct a valid clause from the RHS. 
If we assume the incoming variables on the RHS, we get a conflict.
Therefore, one of them must be different, so the clause consisting of all the negations of those atoms must be true
so we can learn it.

However, that doesn't tell us if the new clause is useful. For example, cutting at the end just gives us back the conflicting clause. Other cuts can give us really large clauses or just not useful ones.

As we don't keep track of previous guesses, we need some way to ensure that we are making progress.

#### Unique implication points

We want to find some clause that means that we can learn something. One
way for the clause to be useful is if we can show it can infer further assignments 
at a previous level.

To do this, we look for a cut where there is only one node in the current layer with outgoing edges
from the LHS to the RHS.
That will mean the clause will have only one variable from the current layer and we can immediately
infer that variable.

We call such cuts unique implication points (UIP). These essentially correspond to nodes which "dominate" all nodes
in the conflict from the current layer. Alternatively, if we restrict the DAG to the current layer and to those in the conflict
then it corresponds to a node where all paths pass through it. 

We know there is such a cut, as if we put every node on the current
layer on the right except the guess, then that node is clearly the only node in the current layer. We will call that the maximal UIP

#### Least UIP

We can do better and find the least UIP. The least UIP is the UIP closest to the conflict.
This will correspond to the smallest possible clause. To do this, we can note the order of assignments.
By the fact that they were constructed in order, these are a topological ordering of the nodes.

We can use this to find the least UIP. We start with the set of conflicting variables, 
then we repeatedly pick the node last in topological order and replace it with its dependencies
(i.e. move it over the cut). The topological order means we know we will never find another incoming edge
into this node so it remains a valid cut. Eventually, we will try and move a UIP over the cut.
By topological ordering, there are no nodes that will point into it. 
As it is a UIP, there must be no lower nodes either, so we are done.

Note that the least UIP is not the only option.

It's also worth noting that we can also simplify in earlier layers.
The simplest is to note that any level 0 node is not useful as there is no guess at layer 0, so
we can always cut around all of level 0. Another is to look at nodes that are just implied by existing nodes.

#### Guessing

There is much in the literature about guessing. A popular strategy is variable state independent decaying sum.
We weight each atom by how often it is seen in clauses, increasing it as new clauses are seen. We then periodically
divide each score by a constant.

This gives a recency bias to variables in learned clauses, attempting to satisfy them further.

### Implementation

This section sketches a simple implementation.

#### Variables, atoms, and clauses

We make a variable be a wrapper around a `usize` which
references the actual variables stored somewhere.

This gives us cheap operations. We will also assume that
variables are somewhat contiguous.

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, Debug)]
struct VarRef {
    id: usize,
}
```

We also have atoms. These could be implemented in half the size by
using the top bit. But for now, we haven't done that.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Atom {
    var: VarRef,
    polarity: bool,
}
```

Finally, we have clauses:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, Clone)]
struct Clause {
    body: Vec<Atom>,
}
```

For all of these, there are also utility methods that are hopefully self-documenting.

#### Unit propagation

The result of unit propagation on a single clause is one of 3 things:
  - A conflict
  - A unit to propagate
  - Nothing

```rust
enum SingleUnitPropResult {
    Conflict,
    None,
    UnitProp { inputs: Vec<Atom>, output: Atom },
}
```

Now for the implementation:

```rust
impl Clause {
    // Unit propagate a single clause
    fn unit_prop_clause(
        &mut self,
        assignments: &[Option<bool>],
    ) -> SingleUnitPropResult {
        
        // The single unassigned non-conflicting variable
        // Or none if all variables conflict
        let mut unit_result: Option<Atom> = Option::None;

        
        for atom in &self.body {
            // Check if the atom is assigned
            match &assignments[atom.get_var().id] {
                Some(assignment) => {
                    // It is assigned
                    if atom.polarity() == *assignment {
                        // Clause is true
                        // Nothing useful
                        return SingleUnitPropResult::None;
                    } else {
                        // This assignment conflicts
                        // Keep looking
                    }
                }
                None => {
                    if let Some(_) = unit_result {
                        // 2 unassigned atoms
                        // Can't do much useful
                        return SingleUnitPropResult::None;
                    } else {
                        // Otherwise this is the only unassigned variable
                        unit_result = Some(*atom);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if let Some(unit) = unit_result {
            // Single unassigned variable 
            // Create the unit prop result
            let mut atom_deps: Vec<Atom> = Vec::new();
            for atom in &self.body {
                match &assignments[atom.get_var().id] {
                    Some(assignment) => {
                        if atom.polarity() != *assignment {
                            atom_deps.push(atom.negated());
                        }
                    }
                    None => {}
                }
            }
            SingleUnitPropResult::UnitProp {
                inputs: atom_deps,
                output: unit,
            }
        } else {
            // All atoms are assigned and none are true
            SingleUnitPropResult::Conflict
        }
    }
}
```

For the higher level, we need a bit more state.

We'll start with the nodes for tracking the derivation graph

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
enum DerivationGraphNode {
    Guess { level: usize },
    Derivation { level: usize, inputs: Vec<Atom> },
}
```

From this, we will construct the state with assignments and
the derivation graph and the clauses.

```rust
struct State {
    clauses: Vec<Clause>,
    assignment_stack: StackStack<Atom>,
    assignments: Vec<Option<bool>>,
    derivation_graph: Vec<Option<DerivationGraphNode>>,
}
```

We also need to handle the result

```rust
enum FullUnitPropResult {
    Conflict { inputs: Vec<Atom> },
    Done
}
```

Now for the loop

```rust
    fn unit_prop_scan(&mut self) -> FullUnitPropResult {
        // Scan all clauses and unit propagate
        // until no more unit propagation is possible
        // or until a conflict is found
        // We will use a flag to indicate if we have done something
        // in the last iteration and wait until we have done nothing
        // to stop
        let mut done_something = true;
        while done_something {
            done_something = false;
            for clause in self.clauses.iter_mut() {
                match clause.unit_prop_clause(&self.assignments) {
                    SingleUnitPropResult::Conflict => {
                        // Report the conflict
                        return FullUnitPropResult::Conflict {
                            inputs: clause.body.iter().map(|x| x.negated()).collect(),
                        };
                    }
                    SingleUnitPropResult::None => {
                        // Nothing to do
                    }
                    SingleUnitPropResult::UnitProp { inputs, output } => {
                        let node = DerivationGraphNode::Derivation {
                            level: self.assignment_stack.len(),
                            inputs,
                        };
                        self.derivation_graph[output.get_var().id] = Some(node);
                        self.assignments[output.get_var().id] = Some(output.polarity());
                        self.assignment_stack.push_value(output);
                        // Ensure we traverse everything a second time.
                        done_something = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // If we scanned all clauses and did not find anything
        // we are done
        FullUnitPropResult::Done
    }
```

#### Conflict Analysis

Now for the code to analyze the conflict. This wants to traverse the frontier
and keep moving it until we hit the UIP.

The initial conflict and the updating are very similar. In fact, they are 
the same. So instead of handling them separately, the loop considers
a pair of the frontier and a clause of values.

Let's start with the signature and some context.

```rust
    /// Analyze the conflict, find a UIP and generate a new clause.
    /// This also returns the level to reset to.
    fn analyse_conflict(&self, inputs: &[Atom]) -> (Clause, usize) {
        // The level of the current assignment stack
        let cur_level = self.assignment_stack.len();
```

Now for the result which we will update
```rust
        // The highest level of the frontier excluding the current level
        let mut reset_level = 0;
        // The nodes in previous levels of the frontier
        let mut result_body = Vec::new();
```

Variables tracking the frontier
```rust
        // The frontier is a vector of booleans
        // each index corresponds to a variable and true
        // means that the variable is in the frontier
        let mut frontier = vec![false; self.assignments.len()];

        // The number of frontier variables in the current level
        let mut cur_level_size = 0;
```
The remaining variables for the assignment iterator
```rust
        // The iterator over the assignments backwards
        // The requirement is this is a topological order
        // over the derivation graph
        let mut iter = self.assignment_stack.peek_stack().iter().rev();

        // The next conflict to resolve
        let mut next_conflict = inputs;
```

The loop starts by discharging the conflict into the frontier.
It moves every node into the frontier. If they are new 
and in the current level, the counter goes up. If they are new from a 
previous level, they are added to the result.

```rust
        loop {
            // Start by moving the next conflict to the frontier
            for atom in next_conflict {
                let seen_prev: bool = frontier[atom.get_var().id];
                if !seen_prev {
                    frontier[atom.get_var().id] = true;
                    if let Some(node) = &self.derivation_graph[atom.get_var().id] {
                        if node.level() == cur_level {
                            cur_level_size += 1;
                        } else if node.level() != 0 {
                            // This node contributes to the
                            reset_level = reset_level.max(node.level());
                            result_body.push(atom.negated());
                        } else {
                            // This is a level 0 node
                            // so it does not need to be added
                        }
                    } else {
                        panic!("Node not found in derivation graph, but was in conflict");
                    }
                }
            }
```

Next, we must look for the next node to move over the frontier and remove it

```rust
            let next_frontier = loop {
                let Some(atom) = iter.next() else {
                    panic!("Could not find a UIP")
                };
                if frontier[atom.get_var().id] {
                    frontier[atom.get_var().id] = false;
                    cur_level_size -= 1;
                    break atom;
                }
            };
```

If it is the only node in the frontier, it was a UIP and we are done.

```rust
            if cur_level_size == 0 {
                // This is the UIP
                result_body.push(next_frontier.negated());
                return (Clause::new(result_body), reset_level);
            }
```

Otherwise, we take the inputs as the next conflict to handle.

```rust
            match &self.derivation_graph[next_frontier.get_var().id] {
                Some(DerivationGraphNode::Guess { .. }) => {
                    panic!("Found the guess node, but expected it to be a UIP");
                }
                None => {
                    panic!("Node not found in derivation graph, but was in conflict");
                }
                Some(DerivationGraphNode::Derivation { inputs, .. }) => {
                    // We have found the next conflict to resolve.
                    next_conflict = inputs;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

#### All together

For now, we will choose a silly guessing system that picks the first variable and 
sets it to true.

```rust
    // A silly guess function for now
    fn guess(&self) -> Option<Atom> {
        // Guess the next variable to assign
        // We will use the first unassigned variable
        for (i, assignment) in self.assignments.iter().enumerate() {
            if assignment.is_none() {
                return Some(VarRef { id: i }.as_atom(true));
            }
        }
        None
    }
```

We need code for making a guess. This adds it to the graph and
the stack.

```rust
    fn make_guess(&mut self, guess: Atom) {
        // Make a guess
        // We will use the first unassigned variable
        let node = DerivationGraphNode::Guess {
            level: self.assignment_stack.len(),
        };
        self.derivation_graph[guess.get_var().id] = Some(node);
        self.assignments[guess.get_var().id] = Some(guess.polarity());
        self.assignment_stack.push_stack();
        self.assignment_stack.push_value(guess);
    }
```

Finally, we can put this all together in the core.

```rust
    fn sat(&mut self) -> bool {
        loop {
            match self.unit_prop_scan() {
                FullUnitPropResult::Conflict { inputs } => {
                    if self.assignment_stack.len() == 0 {
                        // We are done (UNSAT)
                        return false;
                    }
                    let (conflict_clause, reset_level) = self.analyse_conflict(&inputs);
                    self.clauses.push(conflict_clause);
                    // Reset the assignment stack to the reset level
                    // We will pop the stack until we reach the reset level
                    while self.assignment_stack.len() > reset_level {
                        for var in self.assignment_stack.pop_stack_iter() {
                            // Remove the variable from the assignment
                            self.assignments[var.get_var().id] = None;
                            // Remove the variable from the derivation graph
                            self.derivation_graph[var.get_var().id] = None;
                        }
                    }
                }
                FullUnitPropResult::Done => {
                    let guess = self.guess();
                    if let Some(guess) = guess {
                        self.make_guess(guess);
                    } else {
                        // We are done (SAT)
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

### Running the code

We will start with a simple interface that takes lines of CNF.
We will assume that the input is in CNF and that each line is a clause.

```rust
fn run_cnf(input : impl BufRead) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut var_manager: HashMap<String, VarRef> = HashMap::new();
    let mut max_var = 0;
    let mut clauses = Vec::new();

    for line in input.lines() {
        let line = line?;
        let mut atoms = Vec::new();

        for atom in line.split_whitespace() {
            let (name, polarity) = if atom.startsWith('!') {
                (atom[1..].to_string(), false)
            } else {
                (atom.to_string(), true)
            };

            let var_ref = var_manager.entry(name).or_insert_with(|| {
                let var = max_var;
                max_var += 1;
                VarRef { id: var }
            });

            atoms.push(var_ref.as_atom(polarity));
        }
        if atoms.is_empty() {
            // Terminate on empty line
            break;
        }
        clauses.push(Clause::new(atoms));
    }

    let mut state = State::new(clauses, var_manager.len());
    let sat = state.sat();
    if sat {
        println!("SAT");
        for var in var_manager.iter() {
            let val = match state.assignments[var.1.id] {
                Some(true) => "1",
                Some(false) => "0",
                None => "_",
            };
            println!("{} {}", var.0, val);
        }
    } else {
        println!("UNSAT");
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Some examples:

```
a b
!a !b

SAT
a 1
b 0
```

An example where a conflict is hit:
```
!a b
!a !b

SAT
a 1
b 0
```
